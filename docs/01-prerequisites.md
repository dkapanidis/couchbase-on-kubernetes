# Prerequisites

## Google Cloud Platform

This tutorial leverages the [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) to streamline the provisioning of a Kubernetes cluster and the necessary compute infrastructure required to run a Couchbase cluster. [Sign up](https://cloud.google.com/free/) for $300 in free credits.

[Estimated cost](https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator/#id=1dc8801f-7903-432c-8eb3-f3b73b10be4d) to run this tutorial: $0.43 per hour ($10.31 per day).

> The compute resources required for this tutorial exceed the Google Cloud Platform free tier.

## Source

The Couchbase on Kubernetes repository holds a collection of configuration files and scripts that must be downloaded onto the machine used to follow this tutorial. Use the `git` command to clone this repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/spiddy/couchbase-on-kubernetes.git
```

The remainder of this tutorial assumes your working directory is the root of the cloned repository. Move into the `couchbase-on-kubernetes` directory:

```shell
cd couchbase-on-kubernetes
```
